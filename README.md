# IP-Addressing-And-Blocks

This project deals with IP addressing, where the main goal was to design a tool that takes the IP address along with the subnet mask as input and, then, gives the validity of the IP, along with the first address, last address, and the number of addresses in the block. Keeping the size of this block constant, it should give at least other three blocks available of the same size with their network address.
